<h1>Suzanne Collins' Website Renaissance</h1>
<h2>CC Sprint 1: Personas & Design Decisions</h2>
<h5>by Natali Anderson</h5>

<br>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The client, Suzanne Collins, has requested a website revamp that more aligns with her series The Hunger Games. The project will include checkpoints or “sprints” to organize the design and development process. These sprints include personas and design decisions, mockups, and bootstrap development. The project deliverables include low-to-mid fidelity mockups of the desktop and mobile versions of the site,  a Bootstrap web site that includes one user flow, and a final presentation. </p>
<p>The design will include a landing page that contains a section with each of the Hunger Games books. This will be the first section after the header to gain viewer attention. There will also be a redesign of the products page. Each book will be under a category, the Hunger Games series under sci-fi will be at the top of the list. Each product will include title, image, author, description, rating, reviews, and an option to purchase. Upon hover of the images there will be a brief synopsis on the book along with the number of additions to shopping carts on the site to show some key metrics. The fonts and colors will be inspired by the Hunger Games to align the aesthetic to the books.
